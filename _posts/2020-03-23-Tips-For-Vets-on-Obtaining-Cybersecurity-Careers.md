title: Tips for Military Members looking for a career in Cybersecurity
---

### Notes: 
- These tips are strictly from my POV (And are my OPINION ONLY)– I was in the Navy – so I recommend you do some research or talk to your career counselor if you’re part of a different branch to find equivalent programs. 
I’m Blue Team… so my recommendations are focused on becoming a blue team member. 
- I recommend starting on this path as early as possible!

### Degree or Certifications? 
Some companies, or organizations want to see a degree on your resume, and some want to see certifications. I say you need BOTH.

### On Degrees:
- Do it online, but make sure the school is accredited
- CLEP Basic classes
- Find a school that gives you credit for certifications (I got around 30 credits for CISSP at AMU towards my BS)
- Do it while you are still in the military! 
- Use Tuition Assistance!
- Use the Post 9/11 GI Bill for a graduate certificate (SANS STI is a great option to also get certs), or your masters

### On Certifications: 
- Read this and find the certs that work for you: https://i.redd.it/yo33xlys53141.png
- Use Navy COOL
- See if your command will pay for any certs
- Free or Cheap ($) Certifications:
- Access Data – ACE
- EnCase Certified Examiner (EnCE) Certification Program
- Federal Virtual Training Environment (FedVTE)
- National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C)

#### The way I did it:
- Entry Level: Security+, Linux+ (Then you get LPIC-1 free [https://www.lpi.org/comptia])
- Mid-Level: GCIH
- Specializations (Hard): CISSP, GCFE, GCFA, GNFA, GREM

### Misc Tips:
- Participate in CTFs, or Blue Team exercises
- Keep a blog – publish your work, show off what you know/can do
- Use LinkedIn – make sure your profile is clear and concise. When friending someone in the security community – include a message! 
- Don't use acronyms or jargin on your resume – translate your valuable skills into business terms!
- Get help with resumes, job hunting, mock interviews - Hire Heroes USA, Hiring Our Heroes
