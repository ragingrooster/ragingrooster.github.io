## Getting Started
If you read my About page before checking out this blog post, then you know that I'm not one for reinventing the wheel. My intentions for this blog are twofold. First, I intend to use it to cement what I've learned about malware analysis from those already paving the way. And second, to try and give back to the community at large. Considering the latter, I would be remiss if I didn't first provide a short post about what malware analysis is and who malware analysts are. I'll attempt to keep my posts in TL;DR format for you. In essence, I’ll do the heavy lifting and you just get the meat and potatoes from the best sources available.

## TL;DR:

### What is a Malware Analyst?
Someone who examines malicious software to determine its functionality using specialized tools and methodologies. Successful malware analysts typically are:
- Resourceful
- Inquisitive
- Problem Solvers
- Independent
- Self-aware
- Quick learners
- Critical thinkers

They also possess skills in, or have knowledge of:
- Operating System Internals
- Network Protocols
- Scripting/Coding/Programming (Python, C, Assembly, etc.)
- Reverse Engineering (debugging/dissembling)
- Technical Writing/Reporting
- Cybersecurity concepts

Employers often require/request:
- A Bachelor's Degree, typically in Computer Science, or a related study (i.e. Information Systems Security, Cybersecurity, or Digital Forensics)
- Certifications like Security+, CEH, GIAC Malware Analysis Certification (GREM), Certified Reverse Engineering Analyst (CREA, SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert (SLAE)

It takes time and dedication to become a successful malware analyst.

### What is Malware Analysis?
The process of determining the capabilities and functionality of malicious software. This is achieved through static and behavioral analysis.

Basic static analysis: 
- Code is not executed 
- Code is not reviewed
- Determine file properties and extract metadata (file type, hashes, strings, etc.)
- Scan with anti-virus, or other automated tools (Cuckoo, Hybrid Analysis, etc.)

Advanced static analysis:
- Code is not executed
- Code is reverse engineered with disassemblers (IDA, Hopper, Binary Ninja, etc.) 

Basic behavioral (dynamic) analysis: 
- Code is executed
- Analyst interacts with sample in sandbox using specialized tools that monitor system changes (System Internals Suite, CaptureBAT, Regshot, etc.) 

Advance behavioral analysis:
- Code is executed
- Code is reverse engineered with debuggers (OllyDbg, x32/x64dbg, etc.)

Malware Analysis is not a straight forward process. It often requires mixing and matching the above techniques and repeating steps, or even analysis multiple times. Grit required.

That's it for now. I hope you found this information useful and that you will come back for more. Feel free to shoot an email to ragingroosterrem@gmail.com with any questions, or comments. Until next time, 43 68 65 65 72 73 21!
