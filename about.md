## Why this blog?

There's a great deal of amazing resources out there related to malware and malware analysis,
but I feel it is still difficult to become a "malware analyst," let alone a "reverse engineer". 

I personally consider Malware: Fighting Malicious Code, Malware Analyst's Cookbook,
and Practical Malware Analysis bibles on Malware Analysis. But, these books alone 
have over two-thousand pages! So, how can someone read these books and other resources, 
retain the information, and practically apply it? Why, take lots notes of course! 

This blog is my attempt to organize, store, and build upon my knowledge of malware
and malware analysis in hopes of becoming a reverse engineer. I'm hoping it ends up as a sort of
Spark Notes for Malware Analysis, or at least just a good reference for fledgling analysts (pun intended).

## Whoami?

I'm a Cyber Security Analyst working at Rubica, Inc. I have a background in Digital Forensics
and Information Systems Security from my time in the US Navy. I currently hold GCIH, GCFE, and
CISSP. I have a BS in ISS from American Military University and am working on a graduate 
certificate in Incident Response from SANS Technology Institute.

## What's with the rooster?

Let me stop you there... that is not a rooster. 

Have you ever seen a rooster with a dragon tail, or dragon wings? 

No?... That's because a rooster with serpent-like features is a cockatrice. 
Medieval bestiaries say cockatrices hatch from rooster eggs incubated by snakes. 
Some cockatrices can breathe fire, while others spit acid, but all adults can reportedly
turn you to stone with mere eye contact. Neat, right?

When we talk about malicious software we use terms like "bug" and "worm"... 
Well, roosters eat bugs, worms, and insects which I find fitting. Besides, I didn't 
really want a plain old rooster as a mascot, hence the mighty aberration known as the cockatrice.
