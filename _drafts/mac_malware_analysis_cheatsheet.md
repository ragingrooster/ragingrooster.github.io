```
## Process for Mach-O extraction from a .dmg:
```
Note: Replace MacKeeper with the name of your macho, its here as a placeholder/example.

1. hdiutil attach MacKeeper.dmg
2. find the Info.plist
3. pliutil -p Info.plist | grep "CFBundleExecutable"
4. Identify the bin that will be executed, in this case its MacKeeper
5. cd /Volumes/MacKeeper/MacKeeper.app/Contents/MacOS/
6. file MacKeeper
7. lipo -info MacKeeper
8. lipo -detailed_info MacKeeper
Note: If there is more than one architecture listed, proceed to next step if needed. VirusTotal does analysis on both i386 and x86_64, so you could also get the information needed for analysis this way.
9. lipo -extract x86_64 -output MacKeeper_x86_64 MacKeeper
Note: This extracts the x64 version
10. file MacKeeper_x86_64
Note: Verify step six, should display only one architecture now.
```

## Mac File Types:
```
Application Bundles (.app)
Package Files (.pkg)
Mach-O (binary executable)
kext - A kernel extension (or kext) is a dynamically loaded bundle of executable code that runs in kernel space
```
### .app 
typical structure --> To view right click, select "Show Package Contents", or use find
```
Dashboard.app/
Dashboard.app/Contents
Dashboard.app/Contents/Info.plist --> Configuration Info (required; shows versions, bundle ID, owner, creator, etc.)
Dashboard.app/Contents/MacOS/ --> Directory where you typically store an executable
Dashboard.app/Contents/MacOS/Bashboard --> Executable (requried; but this could be a Mach-O, or a shell script)
Dashboard.app/Contents/PkgInfo
Dashboard.app/Contents/Resources/ --> Supporting Files
Dashboard.app/Contents/Resources/Dashboard.icns (icon files)
Dashboard.app/Contents/_CodeSignature --> Apple Dev Signing
Dashboard.app/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources
Dashboard.app/Contents/version.plist
```
### .pkg
eXtensible ARchiver (XAR) Archive
```
need to list & extract binary (malware) with xar & unar
likely contain multiple layers of compression

Ex:
1. Attach the .dmg, but dont execute: hdiutil attach *.dmg
2. List the contents of the .dmg: xar -t -v -f file.pkg
3. Create a temp dir: mkdir temp
4. Unpack the .dmg into temp: unar file.pkg -o temp
```
.pkg files typically include the following:

| Name | Required | Description |
|:------|:--------|:-------------|
| PackageInfo	| Yes	| This is a XML document that contains information about the package behavior and requirements. |
| Bom |	Yes |	This is the Bill of Materials for the files contained in the Payload archive. See mkbom (8). |
| Payload	| Yes	| This is an archive of the hierarchy of files to be installed. The hierarchy is saved as cpio archive | compressed with gzip (or, recently, compressed as a concatenation of LZMA chunks). See cpio(1), ditto(1), gzip(1). |
| Scripts	| Optional |	This is an archive of scripts and additional resources. The hierarchy is saved as cpio archive compressed with gzip. See cpio(1), ditto(1), gzip(1). This file is optional. |
| RunAtStartup | Optional |	This is a shell script that will be supposedly invoked on the next Mac OS X startup. |

See http://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/Ivanhoe/FLAT.html for futher descriptions of each.

### .plist
preference list files, or .plist files
```
- either a plain text .xml file, or a binary file
- view by copying to desktop, clicking on the file, and pressing the spacebar
- use three possible formats: XML, JSON, or a proprietary binary format called bplist
- use utility named plutil in macOS to convert between formats, or simply pretty-print a plist file regardless of its format
- The most notable key in the Info.plist file is the CFBundleExecutable key

<string> </string> - String tags contain alphanumeric character strings.
<real> </real> - Real tags contain a floating-point value.
<integer> </integer> - Integer tags contains an integer value.
<date> </date> - Date tags may contain an absolute date measured in seconds relative to Jan 1 2001 00:00:00 GMT.  A positive value represents a date and time after Jan 1, 2001 date, and a negative value represents a date and time after Jan 1, 2001. A date and time value may be pulled from the local system clock.
<true /> or <false /> - True or false tags represent a YES value or a NO value respectively.  These tags do not have end tags as they simply indicate YES or NO; they do not contain element data. A true or false tag is usually associated with <key></key> tags.
<data> </data> - Data tags store raw data such as a .jpg picture file, human-readable text, or another binary-encoded .plist file.
<array> </array> - .plist elements in an array container are structured as an ordered collection that can be randomly accessed. One array container may have one or many elements stored within. Any element value type may be stored in an array.
<dict> </dict> - A dictionary container usually includes several keys, each paired with a single .plist element. Element values in a dictionary may be a string, number, boolean value, date, data, array, or another dictionary.
```
### mach-o
